# GitHub Repository Structure

Your defence-news-monitor repository should look like this:

defence-news-monitor/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── daily_digest.yml          # GitHub Actions automation
│
├── defence_news_monitor.py           # Main Python script (401 lines)
├── requirements.txt                  # Python dependencies (feedparser)
├── defence_news.db                   # SQLite database (auto-created)
├── README.md                         # Full documentation
└── .gitignore (optional)             # Exclude database if needed

## File Upload Order

1. Create repository on GitHub
2. Upload these files FIRST:
   - defence_news_monitor.py
   - requirements.txt
   - .github/workflows/daily_digest.yml

3. Files created automatically:
   - defence_news.db (after first run)

## GitHub Actions File Location

IMPORTANT: The workflow file MUST be in:
.github/workflows/daily_digest.yml

The exact path matters! If you upload via web interface:
1. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
2. Name it: .github/workflows/daily_digest.yml
3. Paste the content
4. Commit

OR upload as a folder structure with the file inside.

## .gitignore (Optional)

If you don't want to track the database in git:

```
defence_news.db
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.env
```

Note: Keeping defence_news.db in repo is fine - it's what makes delta tracking work across runs.

## File Sizes

defence_news_monitor.py     ~13 KB
requirements.txt            ~20 bytes
daily_digest.yml            ~1 KB
defence_news.db             ~10 KB (grows slowly)

Total: ~25 KB (well within GitHub limits)

## Quick Upload Via Web

1. Go to your new repository
2. Click "uploading an existing file"
3. Create folder .github/workflows manually
4. Upload daily_digest.yml into it
5. Upload other files to root
6. Commit

OR use git command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/defence-news-monitor.git
cd defence-news-monitor
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy files into correct locations
# Then:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup"
