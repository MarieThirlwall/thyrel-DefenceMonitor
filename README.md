## 🏁 Competitor Watch

Any article that matches a tracked competitor name is pulled into a dedicated **Competitor Watch** section at the top of the digest, ahead of the normal per-source listing (it still also appears under its source). Articles containing launch-signal language (`launches`, `unveils`, `partnership`, `raises funding`, `acquisition`, `certification`, etc.) are tagged **🚀 FEATURE LAUNCH**; everything else is tagged **📰 MARKET NEWS**. Launch-signal articles are sorted to the top of the section so product moves stand out immediately.

To track additional competitors, add their name to both `KEYWORDS` and `COMPETITORS` in `defence_news_monitor.py` (~line 181), and optionally add them to one of the `Competitor Watch:` Google News queries in `RSS_FEEDS` for dedicated aggregation.

## 🚀 Quick Setup (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name it: `defence-news-monitor` (or your choice)
3. Set to **Private** (recommended for business intelligence)

**Option A - Web Upload (Easiest):**
1. Download the 3 files I've created
2. On your new GitHub repo page, click "uploading an existing file"
3. Drag and drop:
   - `defence_news_monitor.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `.github/workflows/daily_digest.yml`
4. Commit files

**Option B - Git Command Line:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/defence-news-monitor.git
cd defence-news-monitor

# Copy the files I created into this directory
# Then:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push

## ⚙️ Customization

### Change Email Schedule

Edit `.github/workflows/daily_digest.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 6 * * *'  # Currently 06:00 UTC daily
```

**Common schedules:**
- `'0 9 * * *'` = 09:00 UTC daily
- `'0 6 * * 1-5'` = 06:00 UTC Mon-Fri only
- `'0 */6 * * *'` = Every 6 hours
- `'0 6,18 * * *'` = 06:00 and 18:00 UTC

Use https://crontab.guru/ to create custom schedules.

### Add More RSS Feeds

Edit `defence_news_monitor.py`, find `RSS_FEEDS` dictionary (~line 20):

```python
RSS_FEEDS = {
    "Source Name": "https://example.com/rss",
    "Janes": "https://janes.com/rss",  # Add like this
}
```

### Add/Remove Keywords

Edit `KEYWORDS` list (~line 37):

```python
KEYWORDS = [
    "your new keyword",
    "another term",
]
```

### Change Email Recipient

Update the `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` secret in GitHub Settings

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### No email received?

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs:**
   - Actions tab → Latest run → Check for errors
   
2. **Verify secrets:**
   - Settings → Secrets → Ensure all 5 are set correctly
   - SENDER_PASSWORD must be app password (16 chars, no spaces)
   
3. **Check spam folder**

4. **Test credentials locally:**
   ```python
   import smtplib
   server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
   server.starttls()
   server.login('your@gmail.com', 'your-app-password')
   print("Success!")
   ```

### Getting "0 new articles" every day?

The first run creates the database. All subsequent runs only show **new** articles (delta).

**To reset and see all articles again:**
- Delete `defence_news.db` from your repository
- Next run will show everything

### Want to run manually?

```bash
# Clone your repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/defence-news-monitor.git
cd defence-news-monitor

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export SENDER_EMAIL="your@gmail.com"
export SENDER_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
export RECIPIENT_EMAIL="recipient@email.com"

# Run
python defence_news_monitor.py
```

### Database not updating?

GitHub Actions automatically commits the database back to the repo.

**Check:**
- Repository Settings → Actions → General
- Workflow permissions = "Read and write permissions"

## 💰 Cost

**100% FREE** 

- GitHub Actions: 2,000 minutes/month free tier
- This uses ~5 minutes/month
- No credit card required

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **Keep repository private** - contains market intelligence
2. **Never commit secrets** - always use GitHub Secrets
3. **App passwords only** - never use your main Gmail password
4. **Revoke app passwords** if you suspect compromise

---

## 📊 Advanced Features

### Multiple Recipients

To send to multiple people, edit the script:

```python
recipients = [
    "person1@email.com",
    "person2@email.com"
]

for recipient in recipients:
    send_email_digest(html_digest, recipient)
```

### Export to Google Sheets

Install `gspread` and modify the script to write to Sheets instead of/in addition to email.

### Slack Integration

Replace email function with Slack webhook for team channels.

### Add Web Scraping (for non-RSS sources)

For sites without RSS (like LinkedIn):
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

# Add scraping logic for specific pages
```
